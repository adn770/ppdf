# OSE Core Rules

## Dice Notation
Dice rolls are described with the notation **XdY**:
* **X** is the number of dice to be rolled.
* **Y** is the number of sides on each die.
* For example, **3d6** means "roll three 6-sided dice and add the results together".
* A modifier may be added to the roll, for example **2d4+2** means "roll two 4-sided dice, add the results, and then add 2".

## Key Terms
* **Referee (Ref):** The player who designs the game world, presents challenges, and arbitrates the rules.
* **Players:** The other participants, each controlling a single character.
* **Player Character (PC):** A character controlled by a player.
* **Non-Player Character (NPC):** Any character controlled by the Referee.
* **Party:** The group of PCs who go on adventures together.
* **Adventure:** A single quest or mission, such as exploring a dungeon.
* **Campaign:** A series of adventures, often with a recurring cast of PCs.
* **Ability Scores:** The six scores that define a character's basic capabilities: Strength (STR), Intelligence (INT), Wisdom (WIS), Dexterity (DEX), Constitution (CON), and Charisma (CHA).
* **Class:** A character's profession or archetype (e.g., Fighter, Cleric, Elf).
* **Level:** A measure of a character's experience and power. Characters start at 1st level.
* **Experience Points (XP):** Awarded by the Referee for overcoming challenges. Accumulating XP allows a character to advance in level.
* **Alignment:** A character's moral and ethical stance, chosen from Law, Neutrality, or Chaos.
* **Hit Points (hp):** A measure of a character's ability to survive damage. A character's current hp total is tracked separately from their maximum. Damage reduces current hp.
* **Hit Dice (HD):** The type of die used to determine a character's (or monster's) maximum hit points.
* **Armor Class (AC):** A measure of a character's ability to avoid being hit in combat. This system uses Ascending AC, where higher is better and an unarmored character has a base AC of 10.
* **Attack Roll:** A roll to determine if an attack hits. The roll is `1d20 + Attack Bonus + modifiers` and must equal or exceed the target's AC.
* **Attack Bonus (AB):** A bonus added to attack rolls, representing the character's combat skill. This bonus improves as a character gains levels.
* **Saving Throw (Save):** A roll to avoid or reduce the effect of a special attack, spell, or hazard. There are five categories: Death (or poison), Wands, Paralysis (or petrify), Breath Attacks, Spells (or rods/staves).
* **Movement Rate (MV):** The speed at which a character can move. This is listed as a base rate for exploration and an encounter rate (in parentheses) for combat. For example: **120' (40')**.

# Character Creation

Follow these steps to create a player character:

1.  **Roll Ability Scores:** Roll 3d6 for each of the six ability scores, in order: Strength, Intelligence, Wisdom, Dexterity, Constitution, and Charisma.
2.  **Choose a Class:** Select a character class based on your ability scores. Some classes have minimum score requirements.
3.  **Note Ability Modifiers:** Based on your ability scores, note the associated modifiers on your character sheet.
4.  **Roll Hit Points:** Roll the Hit Die type specified by your class and add your Constitution modifier. This is your starting maximum hp.
5.  **Note Saving Throws and Class Abilities:** Record the saving throw values and special abilities for your class. If you are a spellcaster, note your starting spells.
6.  **Buy Equipment:** Your character starts with 3d6 × 10 gold pieces (gp). Spend this on weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.
7.  **Note Armor Class:** Calculate your character's AC based on the armor and shield they are using, modified by their Dexterity score.
8.  **Note Attack Bonus:** Your character's Attack Bonus (AB) is determined by their class and level.
9.  **Choose Alignment:** Decide if your character is Lawful, Neutral, or Chaotic.
10. **Name Your Character:** Give your character a name and any other finishing details. You are now ready to play!

# Combat

## Combat Sequence Per Round (10 seconds)

1.  **Declare Spells and Retreats:** Players intending to cast a spell or retreat from melee must declare it.
2.  **Initiative:** Each side rolls 1d6. The side with the higher roll acts first.
3.  **Winning Side Acts:**
    a. **Morale Check:** The Referee may check NPC morale.
    b. **Movement:** Characters move up to their encounter movement rate.
    c. **Missile Attacks:** Characters with missile weapons may fire.
    d. **Spell Casting:** Spells that were declared are cast.
    e. **Melee Attacks:** Characters in melee may attack.
4.  **Losing Side Acts:** The side that lost initiative follows the same steps.

## Attacking

1.  **Roll 1d20**.
2.  **Apply Modifiers:** Add the character's Attack Bonus (AB). Add the STR modifier for melee attacks or DEX modifier for missile attacks. Apply any situational modifiers.
3.  **Determine Hit:** The attack hits if the total result is greater than or equal to the target's Armor Class (AC).
4.  **Roll Damage:** If the attack hits, the attacker rolls the appropriate damage die for their weapon, adding any STR modifiers for melee attacks.

## Saving Throws
When a character is subjected to a special attack or effect, they may be allowed a saving throw to avoid or reduce the outcome.
1.  **Roll 1d20:** The player rolls 1d20.
2.  **Determine Success:** If the roll is greater than or equal to the character's saving throw value for that category, the save is successful.

# Magic

## Spells
Certain character classes have the ability to cast spells, which are memorized patterns of magical energy that are forgotten upon being cast. There are two main types of magic.

* **Divine Magic:** Granted by a deity or a higher power. Cast by Clerics.
* **Arcane Magic:** Gained through esoteric study. Cast by Magic-Users and Elves.

A character's class determines which spells they can learn and cast, and their level determines how many spells they can memorize per day.

### Memorizing Spells
A spellcaster can prepare their spells anew after an uninterrupted rest of at least eight hours.
* **Arcane Casters:** Must spend one hour studying their spell book to memorize the spells they wish to prepare.
* **Divine Casters:** Must spend one hour in prayer to their deity to be granted their spells.
* **Duplicate Spells:** It is possible to memorize the same spell multiple times, as long as the character is capable of memorizing more than one spell of that level.

### Casting Spells
To cast a spell, the caster must be able to speak and move their hands freely. When a spell is cast, its pattern is erased from the caster's mind until it is prepared again.
* **Line of Sight:** Unless the spell description says otherwise, the target (creature, object, or area) must be visible to the caster.
* **Concentration:** Some spells require the caster to concentrate to maintain the magical effect. If the caster is distracted or performs another action, the concentration is lost and the spell ends.
* **Cumulative Effects:** Multiple spells cannot be used to increase the same ability (e.g., AC bonus, attack rolls, damage). However, spells affecting different abilities can be combined.

**Rev.:** Yes, **Duration:** Instantaneous, **Range:** The caster or a creature touched

This spell has two possible uses:
* **Healing:** It restores 1d6+1 hit points, but can never exceed the target's maximum hit points.
* **Curing Paralysis:** It negates the effects of paralysis.

#### Reversed: Cause Light Wounds
Inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage to a touched creature. In combat, a successful melee attack roll is required to touch the target.

### Detect Magic
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 2 turns, **Range:** 60'

Magical objects, areas, or creatures are caused to glow faintly in the caster's sight. Both permanent and temporary enchantments are revealed.

### Light
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 12 turns, **Range:** 120'

This spell has three possible uses:
* **Conjure Light:** Creates light in a 15' radius. This magical light is sufficient for reading. The spell can be cast on an object, and the light will move with it.
* **Blind a Creature:** By casting the spell on a creature's eyes. If the target fails a saving throw vs. Spells, it is blinded for 12 turns and cannot attack.
* **Cancel Darkness:** It can dispel a *Darkness* spell.

#### Reversed: Darkness
Creates a 15' radius area of magical darkness that blocks normal vision (but not infravision). Like *Light*, it can be used to blind creatures or to dispel a *Light* spell.

### Protection from Evil
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 12 turns, **Range:** The caster

This spell protects the caster from attacks by creatures of a different alignment (e.g., a Lawful caster is protected from Neutral and Chaotic creatures).
* **Bonuses:** The caster gains a +1 bonus to all saving throws against attacks or special abilities from affected creatures.
* **Attack Penalty:** Affected creatures suffer a -1 penalty to their attack rolls against the caster.
* **Enchanted/Summoned Creatures:** The spell prevents these types of creatures from making melee attacks against the caster. If the caster engages in melee with such a creature, this protection is lost, though the saving throw and attack roll modifiers still apply.

### Magic-User Spells

### Magic Missile
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 1 turn, **Range:** 150'

This conjures one or more glowing darts of energy that the caster can direct at a visible target within range.
* **Automatic Hit:** The projectile hits without fail; no attack roll or saving throw is permitted.
* **Damage:** The projectile inflicts 1d6+1 points of damage.
* **Higher Levels:** The caster can conjure more projectiles, gaining two additional missiles for every five experience levels gained (e.g., three projectiles at 6th-10th level). All projectiles can be directed at a single target or different targets as the caster chooses.

### Shield
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 2 turns, **Range:** The caster

An invisible field of force is created that protects the caster in the following ways:
* **Against Projectiles:** The caster's AC becomes 17.
* **Against Other Attacks:** The caster's AC becomes 15.

### Sleep
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 4d4 turns, **Range:** 240'

This spell causes a magical slumber to come upon a group of creatures or a single individual.
* **Single Creature:** Can affect a single creature of up to 4+1 Hit Dice.
* **Group of Creatures:** Can affect a total of 2d8 Hit Dice of creatures, with each creature being 4 Hit Dice or less. When targeting a group, creatures with the fewest Hit Dice are affected first.
* **Killing:** Creatures enchanted by this spell are helpless and can be killed instantly with a bladed weapon.
* **Waking:** Slapping or non-lethal wounds will awaken an affected creature.
* **Restrictions:** This spell does not affect undead creatures.

### Read Magic
**Rev.:** No, **Duration:** 1 turn, **Range:** The caster

With this spell, the caster can decipher magical inscriptions or runes in the following ways:
* **Scrolls:** The magical pattern of an arcane spell scroll can be understood. The caster can then activate (or copy) the spell from the scroll at any future time.
* **Spell Books:** A spell book written by another arcane caster can be deciphered.
* **Inscriptions:** Magical runes or words on an object or surface can be understood.
* **Re-reading:** Once a text has been read using this spell, the caster can re-read that same text in the future without needing magic.
