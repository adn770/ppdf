# Project: DMme (AI Dungeon Master Engine)

---

## 1. Core Concept

DMme is an AI-powered engine for playing tabletop role-playing games (TTRPGs). It is
composed of three primary components: the **ppdf** indexer, the **dmme** interactive
game driver, and the **dmme-eval** prompt evaluation tool. The system is designed for
both solo play and shared, multi-device sessions with full multilingual support.

The system uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach to ground the Large
Language Model (LLM) in the specific rules and story content of a given game module,
allowing it to act as a knowledgeable and consistent Dungeon Master (DM). All
components are designed to run locally using Ollama.

-   **`ppdf` (The Indexer):** A command-line tool that intelligently parses TTRPG
    adventure modules and rulebooks from PDF files. It uses a multi-step process
    involving text reconstruction and semantic labeling to create persistent,
    language-tagged knowledge bases in a vector database.
-   **`dmme` (The Game Driver):** A web-based application that provides a real-time,
    interactive interface for players. It uses source materials in multiple
    languages to produce a game session in a single, user-selected gameplay
    language. It manages the game session, which is persisted in a **SQLite database**,
    and features automatic session journaling and AI-powered visual aids.
-   **`dmme-eval` (The Evaluation Tool):** A command-line utility designed for prompt
    engineering. It runs a single game input against multiple DM persona prompts in a
    batch, generating comparative outputs to assist in fine-tuning the AI's
    behavior.

## 2. File System Structure

The application will create and manage a hidden directory at `~/.dmme/` to store all
generated data. A single SQLite file will serve as the primary database for all
application data besides the vector stores.

`~/.dmme/`
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ images/
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ <collection_name>/
‚îÇ           ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (*Extracted image files*)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ chroma/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ... (*ChromaDB persistent vector storage*)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dmme.db         (*SQLite database for sessions and journal entries*)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ dmme.cfg

## 3. Backend Design

### 3.1. `ppdf` - The Indexer Utility (Python CLI)

The `ppdf` script is a dedicated utility with two primary modes of operation.

-   **Modes of Operation**:
    1.  **Reformatter Mode (Default)**: If the `--ingest` flag is not present, `ppdf`
        acts as a document conversion tool, using its LLM presets to reformat a PDF
        into a styled Markdown or plain text file.
    2.  **Indexer Mode**: If the `--ingest` flag is present, `ppdf` acts as a
        knowledge base creator for `dmme`.
-   **Indexer CLI**:
    -   `ppdf.py <pdf> --ingest --type <TYPE> --collection <NAME> --lang <LANG> [--image-processing <MODE>]`
-   **Smart Ingestion Process**:
    1.  **Layout & Asset Analysis**: Builds a structured data model and optionally
        extracts graphical assets from the PDF.
    2.  **Text Reconstruction**: Flattens and cleans the text using a `strict` LLM prompt.
    3.  **Smart Chunking**: Applies a top-down, structure-aware chunking strategy.
    4.  **Metadata Enhancement**: Each text chunk is processed by an LLM to add semantic
        labels.
    5.  **Image-to-Text (Optional)**: If image processing is enabled, a multimodal LLM
        generates rich descriptions for extracted images.
    6.  **Storage**: All text chunks and their metadata are stored in the specified
        ChromaDB collection.

### 3.2. `dmme` - The Game Driver (Python / Flask)

The `dmme` backend is a Flask server that links knowledge bases and synchronizes game
state across multiple clients.

-   **Command-Line Interface**: `dmme.py [--port <PORT>] [--ollama-url <URL>] [-v|-d ...]`
-   **Data Persistence**: All application data is stored in a unified **SQLite
    database** (`dmme.db`).
-   **Real-Time State Synchronization**: Uses **WebSockets** (via `Flask-SocketIO`) to
    broadcast game state updates to all connected clients in real-time.
-   **Multilingual LLM Integration**: Constructs a **language-aware prompt**, labeling
    retrieved context with its source language and instructing the LLM on the target
    output language.
-   **REST API**:
    -   **Setup & Management**: `POST /api/game/new`, `POST /api/game/save`, `GET
        /api/collections`, etc.
    -   **Gameplay**: `GET /api/game/command` (streams LLM response, RAG context, and
        visual aid data).
    -   **Visuals**: `POST /api/image/generate`.
    -   **Asset Management**: Endpoints to get asset disk usage and delete assets by
        collection.

### 3.3. `dmme-eval` - The Prompt Evaluation Utility (Python CLI)

A command-line tool for systematically testing and comparing different DM persona
prompts.

-   **Goal**: To assist in prompt engineering by generating side-by-side comparisons
    of LLM outputs.
-   **Command-Line Interface**: `dmme_eval.py --content <NAME> --rules <NAME> --input
    "<TEXT>" [--batch-presets]`

---

## 4. Frontend Design (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)

The `dmme` frontend is a single-page application built using a modern, modular **ES6
JavaScript** structure. Game setup is handled entirely through a UI wizard.

-   **New Game Wizard**: A multi-step modal that guides the user through creating a
    new campaign.
-   **DM View**: The primary interface for the person running the game. It includes:
    -   **Header Controls**: `+ New Game`, `Save`, `Load`, `üìú View Journal`, and
        `‚öôÔ∏è Settings`.
    -   **Status Panel**: An accordion-style list of all party members.
    -   **Inventory Modal**: Accessed via a `üéí` button.
    -   **Narrative Panel**: Displays the game log, recaps, and inline visual aids.
    -   **DM's Insight Panel**: A toggleable panel that shows the raw RAG context
        retrieved for the last turn for debugging.
    -   **Input Panel**: A text area with up/down arrow key command history navigation,
        filtered per-character. Includes a `[üîä On/Off]` button.
-   **Player View**: A simplified, focused interface for a second player.
-   **Modals & UI Feedback**:
    -   All long-running operations will display a clear visual **spinner** or
        "working..." indicator.
    -   **Settings Panel**: A multi-pane modal for application configuration.
        -   **General Tab**: For configuring LLM models and temperature.
        -   **Appearance Tab**: For themes and the "Immersive Content Display" setting.
        -   **RAG Management Tab**: For viewing, deleting, exporting, and importing
            knowledge bases.
        -   **Asset Management Tab**: For managing disk space used by extracted images.

## 8. Potential Future Extensions

This section serves as a wishlist for powerful features that are outside the scope of
the initial implementation plan but could be added in the future.

-   **Dynamic Music & Soundscapes**: An "AI DJ" system where a classifier LLM analyzes
    the narrative and triggers appropriate background music or sound effects from a
    curated local library.
-   **Automated Combat Tracker**: A dedicated UI panel for combat that tracks
    initiative, HP, and status effects, automatically updated by structured JSON
    output from the LLM.
-   **Interactive Map Viewer (Graphical)**: A feature to extract graphical maps from
    module PDFs and display them in the UI, with a token representing the party's
    location that the AI can update.
-   **Adventure Creator Wizard**: A new tool that acts as a "reverse `ppdf`," using an
    LLM to help a user write their own adventure module from an outline.
