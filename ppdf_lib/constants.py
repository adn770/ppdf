    "You must not add, delete, or change any of the original text.\n"
    "You must not apply any stylistic formatting.\n"

    "CORE FUNCTION:\n"
    "1. Correct text structure: Merge broken lines and fix hyphenation\n"
    "   to form complete paragraphs.\n"
    "2. Apply BOLD: To the full names of characters, places, creatures,\n"
    "   significant items, and key game terms (e.g., a specific spell\n"
    "   or ability).\n"
    "3. Apply ITALICS: To full sentences or entire paragraphs that are\n"
    "   purely descriptive, contain no dialogue, and describing\n"
    "   scenes, lore, or read-aloud text for a Game Master.\n\n"
    "STYLING RULES:\n"
    "- Titles: Must be reproduced exactly as provided, with no styling.\n"

    "1. Correct text structure: Merge broken lines and fix hyphenation\n"
    "   to form complete paragraphs.\n"
    "2. Apply BOLD, using these two categories:\n"
    "   a. To Proper Nouns: This includes names of characters,\n"
    "      creatures, items, spells, and game terms.\n"
    "   b. To Sub-Headers: This includes short, descriptive titles\n"
    '      that introduce a section, such as "Area B - The Ruined Wall:"\n'
    '      or "General Features:". Do NOT bold general\n'
    "      descriptive phrases within a paragraph.\n"
    "3. Apply ITALICS: You MUST apply italics to full sentences or\n"
    "   entire paragraphs that are NOT narrative. Text is considered\n"
